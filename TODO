- add crontab analysis with something like this
  for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do echo $user; crontab -u $user -l; done
  this means we need to have root options added to the system or at least
  specify which commands in the list need root access specifically

- need to add support for containers and what not
  if we have the root support then systemctl list-machines seems to do the trick
  on systemd capable machines

- writeup notes on filenames with -> in them

- SELinux support?
