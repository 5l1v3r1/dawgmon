- add crontab analysis with something like this
  for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do echo $user; crontab -u $user -l; done
  this means we need to have root options added to the system or at least
  specify which commands in the list need root access specifically

- need to add support for containers and what not
  if we have the root support then systemctl list-machines seems to do the trick
  on systemd capable machines

- SELinux support; it would be nice if we could monitor SELinux changes to things too

- add OS detection and make commands have different subcommands based on the
  type of OS being detected f.e. execute on fbsd/obsd with find/ls commandline options
  which are standard on the BSDs and on lnx execute with different ones standard
  in the GNU coreutils world
