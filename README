dawgmon - Dawg the Hallway Monitor

The name of this tool is based upon an episode (season 10, episode 10) of South
Park in which Cartman is Dawg the Hallway Monitor patrolling the hallways of
his school.  It's a tool which helps one to monitor changes which have taken
place on a Linux-based system since the previous time the tool was ran. 

One way to use it is to monitor a whole swath of servers via ansible as dawgmon
can automatically generate playbooks as well as parse and process the output
produced by ansible. Combining it with a cronjob which runs dawgmon on a
regular basis and then mails the result to the mailbox of the system
administrator can help with identifying machines upon which nefarious things
are happening.

The other way it's useful is by generating a baseline before installing a piece
of software. Then after installing this piece of software one will run the tool
again and then it's easy to see which changes were made on the system. An
example after establishing a baseline and then installing tor on an AWS Ubuntu
Linux machine might yield something like this:
